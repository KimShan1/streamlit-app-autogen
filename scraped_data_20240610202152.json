        "body": "Hi allAre there more examples of Autogen skills / agents / floating around out there?\n\nAutogen Studio seems to be set up in a way that would allow us to plug/play skills and agents. With that in mind, I am surprised it only comes with only two examples built out, arxiv and image making (and image making is via DallE, right?).\n\nIs there anywhere we can share skills and agents, or browse other examples?\n\nThanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## Update ##\n\nJust wanted to add, when I say skills I mean, the pieces of code and function calls that allow agents to perform tasks. Making an agent, giving it a name and a role/backstory is pretty easy stuff. Giving them abilities is a lot harder and this is where shareability would really shine."
