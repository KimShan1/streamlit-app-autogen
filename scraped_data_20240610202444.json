You can have multiple plans and you can also try to create or edit them dynamically but is always a sequence that your program will follow no matter what.\n\nWith autogen you have a series of agents that decide by themself if they need other information from one another, if they need to use one on their tool (function call), ask the user for more information or terminate the activity because the goal is reached.   \nIt give you framework where you have less control of what is going to happen. \n\nFor this reason the result could be better because the agents finds the best way to solve the problem. Another fact is that could happen that different run, with same input, take completely different path to the result."
